    "Pytorch tutorial is a series of tutorials created by me to explain the basic aspects of PyTorch and its implementation. PyTorch is complex to implement but not difficult. If you see it as a way of documentation or documenting a program, then things get much easier to understand. The most interesting part of this series is that I am also a beginner with PyTorch, so what's difficult me I expect to be difficult for five other individuals also, so at least I expect my tutorial could help five other individuals to implement PyTorch.<br>\n",
